Let's try themes first...

```{r try1}
paths <- fs::dir_ls(path = "thumbnails", regexp = "themes") %>% 
  tibble(image_path = ., image_placeholder = 1:length(.))

paths

tab_1 <- paths %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  text_transform(
    locations = cells_data(vars(image_placeholder)),
    fn = function(x) {
      local_image(
        file = image_path,
      )
    }
  )

tab1
```

```{r try2}
paths <- fs::dir_ls(path = "thumbnails", regexp = "themes") %>% 
  tibble(image_path = ., image_placeholder = 1:length(.))

tab2 <- dplyr::tibble(
  image_placeholder = 1:nrow(paths)) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  text_transform(
    locations = cells_data(vars(image_placeholder)),
    fn = function(x) {
      local_image(
        file = paths$image_path,
      )
    }
  )

tab2
```
