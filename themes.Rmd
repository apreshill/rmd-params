R Markdown comes with some several built-in `theme`s. Themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library. Valid themes include `r knitr::combine_words(rmarkdown:::themes(), before='\x60')`. Pass `null` for no theme. To use a theme for a single .html file output from a .Rmd file, you edit your YAML:

```yaml
title: "Texas Housing Prices"
output_format: 
  html_document:
    theme: flatly
```

# Options gallery


```{r}
theme_links <- link_factory(type = "themes")
#table_factory(links = theme_links)
```

```{r results = "asis"}
theme_links %>% 
  select(contains("list", ignore.case = TRUE), contains("image_html")) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
    gt::fmt_markdown(
      columns = everything()
    )
```

# My render script

And here is the script to generate the themes:

```{r}
render_factory("themes")
```
